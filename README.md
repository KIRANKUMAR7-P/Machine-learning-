Image processing refers to the manipulation and analysis of digital images using computer algorithms. It involves various techniques and operations to enhance, transform, or extract useful information from images. Here are the simplified steps involved in image processing:
Image Acquisition:
The process of capturing or obtaining the image using devices such as cameras or scanners.

Preprocessing:
Remove noise: Apply filters or denoising techniques to reduce unwanted artifacts or disturbances in the image.
Resize and crop: Adjust the size or aspect ratio of the image or focus on specific regions of interest.
Correct color balance: Normalize or adjust the color levels to improve the overall appearance of the image.
Normalize intensity: Enhance or equalize the brightness and contrast of the image.
Segmentation:
Divide the image into meaningful or homogeneous regions based on properties such as color, texture, or intensity. Techniques include thresholding, edge detection, region growing, or clustering algorithms.

Feature Extraction:
Identify and extract relevant features from the segmented regions. Features can include shape, texture, color, or other characteristics that represent meaningful information for further analysis.

Image Enhancement:
Improve the visual quality or interpretability of the image. Techniques include sharpening, smoothing, histogram equalization, or contrast adjustment.

Object Recognition and Classification:
Identify and classify objects or patterns in the image based on extracted features. This can involve the use of machine learning algorithms or pattern recognition techniques.

Image Analysis and Interpretation:
Analyze the processed image to extract meaningful information or make decisions based on the desired application. This can include object tracking, image registration, object counting, or measurement of object properties.

Image Visualization and Presentation:
Display or represent the processed image and its analysis results in a suitable format for visualization, interpretation, or communication purposes. This can include displaying images, graphs, histograms, or annotated images.

SPRINT 1 - Create DataFrame from raw ImageFiles
Description MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike. In this SPRINT, your goal is to preprocess the image files given to you and create a pandas dataframe.
Task A - Download the ‘mnist_data.zip’ and read the data in a pandas dataframe.
Task B - Use your Data Engineering skills to create a dataframe which can annotate each image into one of the 26 classes.
